# GAVYAM-WEBSITE
OUR TEAM IS MAKING A WEBSITE NAMED “GAVYAM” WHICH WOULD PROVIDE DATA ABOUT VACCINATION CENTRES, COLLECT FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE REGARDING DIFFERENT COVID VACCINES, AND PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ON PRE AND POST VACCINATION MEASURES. Our idea is to make a website which will be dealing with the rising concern of Coronavirus. Our website will be helpful both for the Indian vaccine companies and for the people who are being vaccinated. In this website we will be providing all the necessary information about the Covid vaccines, for example, it will provide the location of all the vaccination centres where people can get vaccinated, it will provide all the precautions which should be followed after being vaccinated, etc. The main objective is for the analysis of Covid vaccines that are effective on the virus. After a regular interval of time the website will ask the users that if they have any side effects after being vaccinated or if their body has shown some symptoms of Covid-19. In this way we will get data about the vaccines that if there is a need to make changes in the vaccine or is it safe for everyone. In this way it will be helpful for the people and for our nation.
